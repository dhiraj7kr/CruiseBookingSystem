## Installation

To get started with the Cruise Booking System API, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhiraj7kr/cruiseBookingSystem.git
cd cruiseBookingSystem
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

The system uses environment variables for sensitive data like the database URL and API keys. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration values:

```
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection URI>
PORT=5000
```

Make sure to replace `<Your MongoDB Connection URI>` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

## API Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints to manage boats, users, and bookings:

### Boats
- **POST** `/api/boats`  
  Adds a new boat to the system.
  
- **GET** `/api/boats`  
  Retrieves a list of all available boats.

### Users
- **POST** `/api/users`  
  Adds a new user to the system.
  
- **GET** `/api/users`  
  Retrieves a list of all registered users.

### Bookings
- **GET** `/api/bookings`  
  Retrieves a list of all bookings.
  
- **POST** `/api/bookings`

```

By default, the server will run on port `5000`. You should see a message indicating that the server is running:

```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 5000
```
